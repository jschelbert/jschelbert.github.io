Hey there, I'm Jakob and I feel honored that you found my site.
If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Here is a little info about me.
I've studied math at the TU Darmstadt and stayed in academia a little longer to pursue my ambition to make the world a bit better.
More precisely, I did my PhD at the FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg where I developed models and algorithms to route high pressure pipes in a power plant.
After that I gained some consulting experience at Capgemini Consulting.
Today I work for the largest public transport company in Germany, Deutsche Bahn, where I started at DB Analytics and now switched to DB Fahrzeuginstandhaltung.
There, I strive to get the planning processes to the next level and use my optimization knowledge to build models for optimal usage of infrastructure and ressources.
