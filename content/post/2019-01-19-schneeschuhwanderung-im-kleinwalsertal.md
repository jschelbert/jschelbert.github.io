For christmas my sister gifted me a showshoeing tour in the Kleinwalsertal (Kleinwalser valley).
I've been to the Kleinwalsertal before with the workgroup from Erlagen during my PhD but only during the summer (or early autumn).
This was a nice opportunity to get to know the valley by winter.

We were pretty lucky with the weather as it had begun to snow a couple of days earlier.
On the day of our arrival we rented the equipment for potential snowslides and drove to the valley station XXXXX.
From there we hiked to the [Schwarzwasser Hütte](http://www.schwarzwasserhuette.com) which tuned out to be somewhat challenging as we started to walk at around 16:40 and it soon got dark.
In addition it started to snow heavily and the wind was quite annoying.
After about two hours we arrived at the Schwarzwasser Hütte and had an exquisite dinner.
In the morning the snowslide warning went from 2 to 3 because of the fresh-fallen snow from last night.
We decided to go for a smaller tour and to stay vigilant.
